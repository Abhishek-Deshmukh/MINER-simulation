This was with OUT the bricks around and the detector at the base of where the bricks container should have been,
10^6 runs were generated (beamOn 1000000)

CRY_file: the CRY_file which was used during the run

Energy.txt: the energy of each event (I am assuming in the order of time).

EnergyIn.csv: the energy and charge of each particle coming from CRY

CRY_output.csv: A table of particle counts, and total energies for each particle. (can be calculated from EnergyIn.csv)
